# QTLtools-pipeline



This is a pipeline for getting cis-eQTLs results by running the output from gene count matrix on QTLtools on both nominal pass and permutation pass.


QTLtools and snakemake need to be installed for this pipeline.

The instructions for installing QTLtools can be found at https://github.com/ashwin-s-ranade/fastQTL_pipeline/blob/master/install_QTLtools_guide
